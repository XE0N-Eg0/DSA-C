## Introduction

  

Welcome to the **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Series** in C! This repository contains a comprehensive collection of essential data structures and algorithms implemented in the C programming language, along with detailed notes for each topic.

  

Whether you're a beginner or looking to strengthen your fundamentals, this series will help you get a better understanding of DSA concepts.

  

Each chapter in this series focuses on a specific topic and is divided into two main components:

  

-  **Code Implementation**: C programs for the data structures and algorithms.

  

-  **Notes**: Detailed explanations of the concepts, advantages, disadvantages, and key characteristics.
