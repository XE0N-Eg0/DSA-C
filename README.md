# DSA Series in C

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Series** in C! This repository is a comprehensive collection of essential data structures and algorithms implemented in the C programming language, along with detailed notes for each topic.

Whether you're a beginner or looking to strengthen your fundamentals, this series will help you develop a strong understanding of DSA concepts.

Each chapter in this series focuses on a specific topic and is divided into two main components:

- **Code Implementation**: C programs demonstrating the data structures and algorithms.
- **Notes**: Detailed explanations covering concepts, advantages, disadvantages, and key characteristics.
